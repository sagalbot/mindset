        <p>There are forty-eight (48) questions in this evaluation test. Take as much time as you need to answer
            each of the questions. On average, this test takes about fifteen minutes. There are no right or wrong
            answers.

        <p>Read the description of each situation and vividly imagine it happening to you. You have probably not
            experienced some of the situations, but that should not matter. Perhaps neither response will fit; but
            go ahead and choose the cause likelier to apply to you.</p>

        <p>You may not like the way some of the responses sound, but don't choose what you think you should say or
            what would sound right right to other people; choose the response you'd be likelier to have.</p>
